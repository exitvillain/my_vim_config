# my_neovim_config
this is actually my neo vim config! Written purely in Lua. A High-Performance, Modular Neovim Configuration Engineered for Peak Developer Efficiency.
Why Neo Vim instead of vim? Because you can write all of your config files using Lua , a super simple and lightweight language that you can learn quickly. 

Welcome to my pure Lua Neovim configuration. Custom-designed for modern development workflows, this configuration integrates a Language Server Protocol (LSP) that supports JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS, creating a smooth coding experience across multiple languages. Please don't use this. This is me just getting familiar with NeoVim and trying to get my participation up on Github. 

I've implemented numerous unique remaps and integrated various other plugins, all configured for optimal usability. Each part of this configuration contributes to a more efficient and enjoyable coding experience, making development faster, easier, and more powerful. The most useful I think are relative line numbers for jumping around like a wizzard, an awesome color scheme, allowing jj to take be from insert mode to normal mode instead of esc. And showing the file tabs on the top was a big help for me.  Get used to loading in your own plugins! It is fun! 

Check out the awesome look:

Modularity is a prime feature of this configuration with a neatly organized folder structure that separates various elements like auto-completion, remaps, and plugin configurations. This separation allows for easy customization, extension, and maintenance.

Key components include Packer, a lightweight and fast plugin manager, and Telescope, an ultra-extensible fuzzy finder, enhancing file navigation and access. Tree-sitter provides robust syntax highlighting and better parsing, while UndoTree offers a comprehensive visualized undo history.

Shout out to the primeagen, one of my favorite youtubers. He encouraged me to switch from VScode to vim. I followed his youtube video on how to create a pure lua neo vim config using packer. Most of the file structure shown here is taken directly from him.  I followed the Primeagens workflow which is to first to list all the config for downloading whatever plugin you want to include, running a :PackerSync to make sure packer downloads it properly, and then head into my after/plugin folder to add a seperate config file for the individual plugin.    It really is simple when you get used to it.
